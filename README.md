# Matlab-Calculus-Problem

Create a propane tank in such a way that manufacturing its sides were of a different cost
than manufacturing its middle part, while achieving a certain volume, and also while keeping
the developing cost to its minimum.

Load the .m file in matlab and run it. Enter costs and matlab will produce a
3D interactable shape and also produce the expected cost.
